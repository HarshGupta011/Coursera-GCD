The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

1.Loads all the dataset into the memory

      features <- features.txt : (561 rows, 2 columns) : List of all features.
      activity <- activity_labels.txt : (6 rows, 2 columns) : List of all 6 activities
      subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : (2947 rows, 1 column) : Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
      x_test <- test/X_test.txt : (2947 rows, 561 columns) : Test set
      y_test <- test/y_test.txt : (2947 rows, 1 columns): Test labels
      subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : (7352 rows, 1 column): Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
      x_train <- test/X_train.txt : (7352 rows, 561 columns): Training set
      y_train <- test/y_train.txt : (7352 rows, 1 columns): Training Labels

2.Merging test and train values
  X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
  Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
  subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function

3.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  X is modifed to store only mean and standard deviation values
  tidydata (10299 rows, 88 columns):new dataset is created by merging subject, X and Y
4.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  All the labels values in tidydata is replaced by the values according to activity dataset

5.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  label column in tidydata renamed into activity
  All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
  All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
  All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
  All abbreviations of mean,std and freq are fixed

6.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

  AverageData (180 rows, 88 columns): A new dataset is created by sumarizing tidydata by means of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  The AverageData is then written to an external file named AverageData.txt
